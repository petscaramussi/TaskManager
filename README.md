# TaskManager

<img src="https://github.com/petscaramussi/images/blob/main/task/task.png">
This application was made with the purpose of training my skills, mainly with Node + Express, which was my first contact with technology.
Don't expect excellent good practices as this is my first code with this technology.

## About
This application, by now, allow users to create a list and create some tasks inside this lists. Tasks can also be marked as complete or uncompleted. All of tasks and lists is save in MongoDB document

> For future i will implement a login system to link lists with users

## MEAN STACK

The MEAN stack is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies used for building dynamic web applications. The acronym "MEAN" stands for:

### MongoDB:
A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and is known for its scalability and flexibility.

### Express.js:
A back-end web application framework for Node.js. It provides a minimalist and flexible set of tools for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies tasks like handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration.

### Angular: 
A front-end web application framework developed by Google. It allows developers to build dynamic, single-page web applications with rich user interfaces. Angular provides tools for data binding, routing, forms handling, and more.

### Node.js:
A JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that is well-suited for building scalable and high-performance applications.

Together, these technologies form a full-stack development framework that covers both the front-end and back-end of a web application. MongoDB serves as the database, Express.js handles the server-side logic, Angular manages the client-side user interface, and Node.js provides the runtime environment. This combination allows developers to build modern and responsive web applications using a consistent JavaScript-based technology stack throughout the entire development process.
